Presentation Layer

The presentation layer is responsible for presenting the system to the users and handling their interactions. It can be a web page, a mobile app, a desktop application, or any other form of user interface. The user interface layer should be thin and simple, delegating most of the logic and functionality to the application layer.


The presentation layer should also be separated from the domain layer, meaning that it should not depend on the domain objects or concepts directly. Instead, it should use data transfer objects (DTOs) or view models that are tailored to the specific needs of the user interface. This way, the user interface layer can be changed or replaced without affecting the domain layer.
