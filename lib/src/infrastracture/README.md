The infrastructure layer is responsible for providing technical services and resources to support the other layers. It can include databases, message brokers, web servers, cloud platforms, 3rd-party APIs, or any other external components that are required by the system. The infrastructure layer should be generic and adaptable, implementing the interfaces or abstractions that are defined by the domain layer.

The infrastructure layer should also be configurable and interchangeable, meaning that it should allow for different implementations or providers to be used depending on the environment or situation. For example, it should be possible to use a different database or message broker for testing or production purposes. This way, the infrastructure layer can be optimized or replaced without affecting other layers.
