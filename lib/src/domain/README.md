The domain layer is responsible for implementing the core business logic and rules of the system. It contains the domain model, which is a representation of the concepts and behaviors that are relevant to the problem domain. The domain model consists of entities, value objects, aggregates, services, events, and other elements that capture the essence and meaning of the domain.

The domain layer should be rich and expressive, containing most of the logic and functionality of the system. The domain layer should also be isolated and self-contained, meaning that it should not depend on any other layers or external resources directly. Instead, it should define its own interfaces or abstractions that are implemented by other layers, such as repositories or services. This way, the domain layer can be evolved or refined without affecting other layers.
