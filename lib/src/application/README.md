Application Layer

The application layer is responsible for coordinating the actions and workflows of the system. It acts as a mediator between the user interface layer and the domain layer, orchestrating the use cases and scenarios that the system supports. The application layer should be thin and stateless, containing only the logic that is specific to the application and not to the domain.

The application layer should also be decoupled from the infrastructure layer, meaning that it should not depend on any external resources or services directly. Instead, it should use interfaces or abstractions that are defined by the domain layer, such as repositories or services. This way, the application layer can be tested or deployed independently from the infrastructure layer.
