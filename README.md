Domain-driven design (DDD) is a major software design approach,[1] focusing on modeling software to match a domain according to input from that domain's experts.[2] DDD is against the idea of having a single unified model; instead it divides a large system into bounded contexts, each of which have their own model. [3]

Under domain-driven design, the structure and language of software code (class names, class methods, class variables) should match the business domain. For example: if software processes loan applications, it might have classes like "loan application", "customers", and methods such as "accept offer" and "withdraw".

Domain-driven design is predicated on the following goals:

placing the project's primary focus on the core domain and domain logic layer;
basing complex designs on a model of the domain;
initiating a creative collaboration between technical and domain experts to iteratively refine a conceptual model that addresses particular domain problems.
